    My work generally lies in dynamic and spectral graph theory and the implementation of plasticity rules to explore the evolution of graphs.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    My current PhD work revolves around building abstract mathematical models of heterosynaptic plasticity learning rules using graph theory and topological analysis.
     This involves primarily studying synaptic plasticity's functional and information theoretic implications at the network level. <a href="docs/GraphTheory.pdf">Here's a little insight into this work. </a> 

<p align="justify">I am involved in a collaboration with the University of Bristol researching the graph theoretical structures of recurrent neural networks in reservoir computing.

</p>


<p align="justify">I have done work on how deficits in short term plasticity in individuals with psychosis may impact their decision making processes and capacities in working memory. This is mainly through attractor state dynamical systems. <a href="neuromatchimage.html">See a little flavour here.</a>
    <br>
</p>



<p align="justify">I am also interested in using topological data analysis with persistent homology on large datasets to better understand the structures and interconnectedness of neurocognitive performance, such as short-term and working memory, cognitive functions, and processing speed.


<p align="justify">I also have research interests in assessment theory, in a mathematics pedagogical context. See, for example, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-021-01234-5">here.</a>

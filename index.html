								<b>Early education and graduate studies:</b>
								<p align="justify">
								I was born in Milan, Italy, in 1984, and grew up in Rome. During my high school years at Liceo Classico E.Q. Visconti
								I was introduced to ancient literature, history of philosophy and the great questions of life.
								Being fascinated with the fundamental principles of Nature, I decided to learn about them and ended up earning a Bachelor's and a Master’s degree in physics
								at La Sapienza University of Rome. 
								I particularly enjoyed classes in dynamical systems, condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and biophysics. 
								I became interested in neuroscience and machine learning thanks to 
								the lectures in artificial neural networks by Prof. Daniel Amit, where I discovered for 
								the first time that brain circuits can be analyzed and explained with the quantitative 
								methods of physics and mathematics. I then won a scholarship to study abroad and 
								worked for a year in the lab of Prof. Stefano Fusi at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience of Columbia University. 
								The research I carried out in New York, with the co-supervision of Prof. Enzo Marinari, led to my <a href="docs/tesilorspec.pdf">Master’s thesis work 
								on the efficient storage capacity of Hopfield models with correlated patterns</a>.
								<p/>
								<p align="justify">
								I did my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Anne-Lise Giraud at University of Geneva 
								and Prof. Boris Gutkin at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. <a href="docs/thesis_fontolan_HQ_small.pdf"> 
								In my PhD thesis investigated the neural basis
								of speech processing</a>, both with computational models and by analyzing neurophysiological data 
								from human patients. 
								<p/>
								<p align="justify">
								During my postdoc, I have been studying the neurobiological mechanisms and 
								the computational principles of decision-making 
								during motor planning.
								I built computational models of brain circuits and, in collaboration with the laboratory 
								of Dr. Karel Svoboda, tested the predictions from these models with optogenetic experiments in rodents.

								My general interest lies in understanding the neural basis and the evolution of intelligent behavior in animals and humans, 
								hoping that a better understanding of ourselves will lead to a more compassionate and just society.
							</p>
							
							<p align="justify">Currently, my work is focused on building computational models of brain circuits in order to understand
							the neural basis of cognition. I use dynamical systems, statistical and neural network models 
							to investigate how populations of neurons generate behavior. In particular, I have been studying the computational principles 
							behind decision-making, short-term memory and motor preparation. I truly enjoy collaborating with experimental research groups
							to develop a common conceptual framework able to explain cognitive phenomena.<br> During my postdoc at Janelia 
							I primarily worked on two projects:<br>
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
							<b>Project 1. <em>How the brain holds on to short-term memory</em></b><br>
							We designed model-driven optogenetic perturbations
							in the rodent premotor cortex, which allowed us to discriminate between candidate mechanisms of persistent activity, 
							the elevated spiking rates observed in single neurons that bridge sensory inputs with subsequent actions. 
							We were the first to demonstrate that, during short-term memory tasks, cortical activity in rodents is attracted towards a particular 
							set of spike rate patterns, called discrete attractors, that predict the specific future action.

							<p align="justify">
							<b>Project 2. <em>Neural mechanisms underlying the temporal evolution of flexible information flow across the brain</em></b><br>
							Sensory information can give rise to different behaviors under distinct circumstances. 
							To account for this, the brain must dynamically adjust the flow of information between sensory and decision areas.
							In the context of decision-making, we considered whether and how decisions can be vulnerable to 
							distracting sensory inputs before they are enacted.
							Our results indicated that decisions are, at first, vulnerable to interferences, 
							but become more resistant close to the time when decisions must be enacted. 
							To identify the neural mechanisms behind this temporally-evolving gating of sensory information,
							I trained recurrent artificial neural networks (RNNs) 
							to reproduce the activity of neurons recorded from
							the premotor cortex during a binary decision-making task in which decisions were challenged by distracting sensory information. 
							By reverse-engineering the networks, I discovered that decision-related activity patterns 
							in the RNN converged to a pair of stable spike rate patterns – i.e. two stable 
							<em>fixed-points</em> or <em>discrete attractors</em>, one for each decision. 
							Predictions from the RNN model were verified in the experimental data, 
							indicating that attractor dynamics govern how information flows from the sensory to the motor cortex.
							Furthermore, to correctly reproduce the data, the recurrent network required 
							the presence of an external input signalling the passage of time within the trial.<br>
						
							These findings led me to challenge a long-standing hypothesis 
							on the role of slow neural timescales observed during decision-making tasks.
							As we verified experimentally, these slow dynamics reflect 
							the predicted duration of a trial instead of indicating the formation of a decision. 
							Our results provide outlines of a general mechanism underlying flexible routing of information across the brain.

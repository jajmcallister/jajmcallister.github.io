								<b>Early education and studies:</b>
								<p align="justify">
								I was born in South Africa and moved to Ireland in my teens. I did my undergraduate in mathematics in Trinity College Dublin. After this I taught Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics for a short while, before returning to academia to complete a further Masters in research methods and then begin a PhD in Computational Neuroscience.
								<p/>
								<p align="justify">
								Mathematics will always be my first love, so anything I approach will be with a mathematical mindset. However, I also love the biology of things.

								My general interest lies in mathematically modelling learning, memory, and plasticity.
							</p>

							<p align="justify">
								My current work revolves around building mathematical models of heterosynaptic plasticity; this involves studying the role that dendritic geometries, molecular dynamics, and astroglial interactions play in these models. These models seek to capture the mechanisms and the functional implications of heterosynaptic plasticity.
							</p>
							
							
							<p align="justify">I have done work on how deficits in short term plasticity in individuals with psychosis may impact their decision making processes and capacities in working memory. This is mainly through attractor state dynamical systems. <a href="researchmoreinfo.html">See a little flavour here.</a>
								<br>
							</p>
			
							

							<p align="justify">I am also interested in using topological data analysis with persistent homology on large datasets to better understand the structures and interconnectedness of neurocognitive performance, such as short-term and working memory, cognitive functions, and processing speed.

							
							<p align="justify">I also have research interests in assessment theory, in a mathematics pedagogical context. See, for example, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-021-01234-5">here.</a>
